# Translating

In the config.yml, you may change the locale setting. If this option is not set, the plugin
will default to english.

Thanks to our community, we have the following translations...
```
%LANG
```

## Custom Messages

To adjust messages to your liking, you may modify the local property file. Messages may be adjusted
to contain color coding and plugin variables.

If the message is not found, the plugin will return an missing message key to the user.
