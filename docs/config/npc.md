# NPC Crates

CrateReloaded has support for NPC crates. This feature hooks into the **Citizen** plugin to allow you to open a crate when you interact with a NPC.
Therefore, you will need to have the **Citizen** plugin installed. [For installation, click here!](../installation)

!> This requires a free NPC add-on. Check #installation for the download.
